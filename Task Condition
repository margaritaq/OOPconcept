Define a class structure using the OOP principles for the following:
1. a MessageProcessor class that can 'process' different kinds of messages, outputting in console their contents
2. a structure for different Message classes (e.g. XmlMessage, JsonMessage, etc) that will implement a Message interface
3. they should all have a 'name' field with their actual name, and the 'body' field which will have message contents
4. they should all have a constructor method with a String parameter that will be assigned to 'body'
5. each Message should have different 'prepareMessage' methods implemented that will receive different parameter list (empty/String/String, String) that should output in console their parameter values (if any) and the actual message type ('name')
6. a MessageConverter that can 'convert' messages from one type to another ('body' should be the same)
